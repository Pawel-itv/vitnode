Some folders in `apps/frontend/app` are in `.gitignore` and are not included in the repository. All files from these folders are copied when you are using `npm run config:init` to initialize your workspace.

<Callout title="Default pages from VitNode" type="error">
  Do not put any files inside `(vitnode)` folders! They are automatically
  generated by VitNode and can be overwritten.
</Callout>

Below is guide how to create own pages in VitNode using own `plugin`. If your `workspace` is `private` and you don't plan to share your `workspace` with others, you can create pages without `{your_plugin}` folder.

## Default Page

VitNode automaticly create default page for you in your plugin.

import { File, Folder, Files } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/files';

<Files>
  <Folder name="app" defaultOpen>
    <Folder name="frontend" defaultOpen>
      <Folder name="plugins" defaultOpen>
        <Folder name="{your_plugin}" defaultOpen>
          <Folder name="templates" defaultOpen>
            <File name="default-page.tsx" />
          </Folder>
        </Folder>
      </Folder>
    </Folder>
  </Folder>
</Files>

<Callout title="export default">
  The default page is exported as `default`.
</Callout>

Test it by set your plugin as default in `AdminCP` and go to your website.

You can also delete this file if you don't need it, then VitNode after export your plugin will block your plugin to be default.

## Create Pages

Vitnode using [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing) in app directory. All features about `routing` from `NextJS` are available in VitNode for example [Parallel Routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/parallel-routes), [Dynamic Routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/dynamic-routes), [Error Handling](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/error-handling), [Metadata](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/metadata) etc.

You need to remember only where to put your pages if you are creating plugin for VitNode.

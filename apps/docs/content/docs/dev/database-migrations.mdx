## Automatic

You don't need to worry about migration when you're using VitNode, we will handle migrations for you.

When you install, update or remove a plugin, VitNode will automatically generate and apply the migration to your database.

## Manual

If you're making a plugins and you don't want to restart the server, you can generate and apply the migration manually.

We're created `vitnode-backend db` command for you. You can run this command using `package manager`:

import { Tab, Tabs } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/tabs';

<Tabs id='package-manager' persist items={['pnpm', 'npm']}>

```bash tab="pnpm"
pnpm db
```

```bash tab="npm"
npm run db
```

</Tabs>

description: How to use icon in your application using Lucide Icons.

VitNode uses [Lucide Icons](https://lucide.dev/icons/) and Emoji as icons.

## Usage

To use Lucide Icons, we're really recommend you to use JSX from `lucide-react`. It's the best way to use them.

```tsx
import { Home, KeyRound } from 'lucide-react';
```

```tsx
<>
  <Home />
  <KeyRound />
</>
```

### Dynamic Icon

You can use dynamic icons with JSX too. Use this component if you want to download the icons from "text".

```tsx
import { Icon } from 'vitnode-frontend/components/icon/icon';

return <Icon name="Home" />;
```

<Callout title="Only for Server-Side" type="warn">
  This component requires Server Side Rendering _(SSR)_. It won't work on client
  side.
</Callout>

### Dynamic Icon on Client Side

We also allow to using dynamic icon on client side.

```tsx
import { IconClient } from 'vitnode-frontend/components/icon/icon-client';

return <IconClient name="Home" />;
```

<Callout title="Avoid this component" type="error">
  Please avoid using this component. It's not recommended. Use this only if you
  really (REALLY!!!) need it.

This component will download all icons from Lucide Icons to client.

</Callout>
